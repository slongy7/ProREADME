# Title: Readme Generator

## Description
This project is designed to make an easier process for the user create their README at a faster and more accurate way.  It allows the user to run the index.js in their terminal, which allows for a number of questions to show up which they answer.  The answers then create the README.md file in their folder which they can display.

## Bugs
I actually only had one bug, where I would need to close out the old markdown files for the new one to display the correct answers.  My tutor couldn't help me figure that out either.
